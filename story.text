Brian was a cool kid who liked to play video games. One day he got a C+ on his exam and that was the day he decided to focus more on school. He focused so much on school and studying that his hair fell out and his cat died and he lost his mind. He now resides in the Madison Mental Hospital. Cool story huh?
