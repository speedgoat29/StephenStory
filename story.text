Brian was a cool kid who liked to play video games. One day he got a C+ on his exam and that was the day he decided to focus more on school.
He focused so much on school and studying that his hair fell out and his cat died and he lost his mind. He now resides in the Madison Mental Hospital. Cool story huh?
Once Brain got out of the hospital, he began to notice something strange. His head would have the most blinding pain while he was taking tests, but when it happened, he knew every answer. He worked his way up and by the end of the year he had the best grades out of all of his class.

He then partied so hard that he ended up back into the hospital. He started to get terrible grades, went to to many parties. Then he said enough is enough and he payed alot of attention to his classes
